Description: The BGCViz is a shiny application, which takes
    BGC annotation results from antiSMASH, PRISM, SEMPI, 
    ARTS, DeepBGC, RREFinder and contructs several plots
    to pinpoint either clusters which are annotated several times, 
    or which are unique for certain tools. We believe that this
    would help to contruct more full BGC landscape in newly sequenced genomes.
